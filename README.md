```

### C++ compiler with C++20 support
Set your preferred IDE to enable C++20 support. 
Make sure that you can run C++20 code. Try running some sample code and see whether it can successfully run and produces correct output.

You can try this sample code:
```
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    auto result = (10 <=> 20) > 0;
    std::cout << "result: " << result << std::endl;
}

```
The correct output should be:
```result: 0```

In case you are using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and you are not able to enable C++20 support. You can try to download Microsoft Visual Studio (Visual Studio) instead (see `Troubleshooting (for Windows)` > `C++20 related Issues` section below).

### Install CMake

And then press `Next`, and wait for the installation.

** Please note that the installation may take time since there are a lot to install.

After the installation is complete, you can exit the installer.

According to your installation folder and Qt version, add a new system variable:
```
QT_PATH     C:\Qt\6.2.4\mingw_64
```

### Install MinGW-W64

If you do not have MinGW-W64 installed, download the 12.1.0 MSVCRT runtime version from here https://winlibs.com/

Extract the zip file to your C: drive, then add `C:\mingw64\bin` to PATH in system variables.

### Install Boost 1.79.0

Download boost zip folder from: https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_79_0.html

Extract to C: drive.

Now go to C: drive using Command Prompt, then run:

```
cd boost_1_79_0
bootstrap gcc
b2
b2 --build-dir=build/x64 address-model=64 threading=multi --build-type=complete --stagedir=./stage/x64 -j 4
```

** Preferably use command prompt, as Windows PowerShell might not work when running `bootstrap gcc` command.

** Note that running the last two b2 commands may take time.

Add the following to your system variables:
```
BOOST_BUILD_PATH    "C:\boost_1_79_0\tools\build"
BOOST_INCLUDEDIR    "C:\boost_1_79_0"
BOOST_LIBRARYDIR    "C:\boost_1_79_0\stage\x64\lib"
BOOST_ROOT          "C:\boost_1_79_0"
```

### Cereal

No need to install Cereal as it has been included in this repository.

### Build cpp-xpx-storage-user-app
From cmd, go to the cpp-xpx-storage-user-app directory, then do the following:
```
cd cpp-xpx-storage-user-app
mkdir _build
cd _build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DSIRIUS_DRIVE_MULTI=ON ..
mingw32-make -j 6
```

### Run Storage Client
In the build folder, an executable with the name "cpp-xpx-storage-client.exe" would have been created after the build is complete.
Double click the exe file, and if it crashes, don't worry. A folder with the name "profile" would be created, and file called "settings.ini" will be there.
Open the file and modify the address and bootstrap_nodes settings as follows (assuming blockchain and rest server are running locally):
```
address=localhost:5555
bootstrap_nodes=localhost:3000
```

## Troubleshooting (for Windows)

### Persisting Errors

If you have just done installations and encounter errors when running any command. Try to close your command prompt, restart your PC, and try again.

In case you encounter the same build error after trying out some solutions, you can try to delete the build folder and then re-build again.

### QT related Issues

**Online Installer Error**
- If during installation, you encounter an installation error for a particular file. You can try to press `Retry` to re-install that particular file that rises the error. The installation will usually still run as long as there is no error message (including when you just keep `Retry` re-installing the same file that raises an error).

- If the same installation error message keep appearing after so many times, and it stops the installation. You may try to install Qt version 6.5.0 instead, or the latest version.

- If you encounter any issue with the online installer, you can use an offline installer instead. Sometimes the online installer may have some issue, and you may need to wait for the Qt team to fix it. (Note: It is recommended to install Qt via Online installer whenever possible, since adding components later using the Maintenance Tool from the offline installer might be a bit more difficult to do because you need to find the repository for installing additional components)

&emsp;&emsp;Open this link and try to install the offline installer (if possible, try to install Qt version 6 inside the installer): https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.12/5.12.12/qt-opensource-windows-x86-5.12.12.exe.mirrorlist 

&emsp;&emsp;Tick the components (similar to set of components in online installer, including Qt State Machine as this can be another issue later if not installed)

**Offline Installer Error**

- If during installation, you encounter any file installation error. Keep press `Retry`. If the same error still persists after several times, you can try to press `Ignore`. One possible error may look like this (issue with strawberry-perl installation):

&emsp;&emsp;![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234160337-a2b9cded-4d00-48c6-86f9-3a0f3b471b97.png)

- In this case, you can try to install strawberry-perl manually:
https://strawberryperl.com/releases.html 

&emsp;&emsp;But if you encounter other file installation error, you can try to search up the file online.

- If you encounter error related to Qt versioning, and you installed Qt version 5.

&emsp;&emsp;You can try to change line of code in `cpp-xpx-storage-user-app/CMakeLists.txt` from:

&emsp;&emsp;`find_package(QT NAMES Qt6 COMPONENTS Widgets REQUIRED)`

&emsp;&emsp;Into:

&emsp;&emsp;`find_package(QT NAMES Qt5 COMPONENTS Widgets REQUIRED)`

&emsp;&emsp;![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234164452-7f8ddc2f-f2d1-4f31-8eb6-095d9487b684.png)

### Boost related Issues

**Build and libraries-build issues**

When re-building the Boost or Boost libraries, you can try to check these first:
- Try to clear the cache for Boost to detect again, or try cleaning up before re-building (b2 clean). And make sure everything is build
- Make sure that the Boost version you built was properly installed
- Remember to reset caches (delete CMake cache) when running CMake
- If you get `missing stacktrace_backtrace` error, and you are still not able to build the stacktrace library by using b2 command, then refer to `Missing stacktrace_backtrace error` section below.

**Missing stacktrace_backtrace error**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234193577-a4bc456b-8a46-4b04-a513-729ca70c5d94.png)

If you encounter `missing: stacktrace_backtrace` error on Boost, try the following solution:

1. Exclude/disable stacktrace_backtrace from the required packages in cpp-xpx-storage-user-app/cpp-xpx-storage-sdk/CMakeLists.txt

&emsp;&emsp;You can do this by changing the following:

&emsp;&emsp;`find_package(Boost COMPONENTS atomic system date_time regex timer chrono log thread filesystem program_options random stacktrace_backtrace REQUIRED)`

&emsp;&emsp;Into:

&emsp;&emsp;`find_package(Boost COMPONENTS atomic system date_time regex timer chrono log thread filesystem program_options random REQUIRED)`

&emsp;&emsp;And comment out:

&emsp;&emsp;`add_definitions(-DBOOST_STACKTRACE_USE_BACKTRACE)`

&emsp;&emsp;`set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG} -DSHOW_BACKTRACE")`

&emsp;&emsp;![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234169312-621a1baf-288a-4d9a-bfb7-1683d121a161.png)

2. **_(Do not use this solution, refer to option 1 instead)_** Install libbacktrace (https://github.com/ianlancetaylor/libbacktrace) (instructions to install is written below on section `Libbacktrace installation`)

**libbacktrace installation**
**IMPORTANT NOTICE: (Do not use this! We need to skip using libbacktrace/stacktrace since there are reports about libbacktrace that causes deadlocks. i.e. Skip this, no need to install libbacktrace. Instead we need to disable the use of backtrace in the project as described in option 1. This is provided only for reference in case it is needed in the future.)**

If your Boost is not able to detect stacktrace library (stacktrace is not found). You can try to install libbacktrace separately.

Open the link:
https://github.com/ianlancetaylor/libbacktrace 

Go to `Code > Download ZIP`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234193872-fa969aee-a670-4507-acf9-6f6743f0f052.png)

Extract the Zip file on your `C drive`.

Download `MSYS2` by following instructions in this link:
https://www.msys2.org/ 

Just follow step 1 to 5. Step 6 onwards is about downloading MinGW. We do not need to follow it because we already install MinGW version we wanted earlier.

After that, follow these steps:
1. Open `MSYS2 UCRT64`
2. Navigate to your extracted libbacktrace folder. For example, if you extract it at `C:/libbacktrace-master`, then use `cd /c/libbacktrace-master`
3. Run `./configure` by specifying the gcc and g++ file path from the MinGW you installed earlier. For example, `./configure CC=/c/mingw64/bin/gcc.exe CXX=/c/mingw64/bin/g++.exe`
4. Run `make` command. Make sure `libbacktrace.la` is produced, because it is required for the next step.

&emsp;&emsp;If your `MSYS2` does not have `make` command yet, install it first. (Other command installation is similar to this, please search it up on the internet for relevant command installation on `MSYS2`)

&emsp;&emsp;![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234170671-0a4d754a-71da-4111-befe-0c469e228848.png)

5. After that, run `./libtool --mode=install /usr/bin/install -c libbacktrace.la '/c/libbacktrace-master'`
6. Go to your installed Boost folder, and find `project-config.jam`
And paste this:
`using gcc : 6 : "C:/mingw64/bin/g++.exe" : <compileflags>-I"C:/libbacktrace-master/" <linkflags>-L"C:/libbacktrace-master/" ;`
7. In Command Prompt, you can run this:
`b2.exe toolset=gcc-6 --with-stacktrace`

The link below is used as reference by the instructions written above (cited from instructions under the section `MinGW and MinGW-w64 specific notes`). Please follow the instructions written above.

https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/doc/html/stacktrace/configuration_and_build.html

**Issues in libbacktrace/MSYS2 (MSYS2 is used for separate libbacktrace installation)**

Possible errors after you run `make` command:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234187731-bb4befdb-402a-4297-8eec-7da1d4c78ace.png)

1. `libtool: link: warning: undefined symbols not allowed in x86_64-w64-mingw32 shared libraries`

&emsp;&emsp;Solution sources:

&emsp;&emsp;https://github.com/Ancurio/SDL_sound/issues/3 

&emsp;&emsp;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61215047/how-to-fix-libtool-undefined-symbols-not-allowed-in-x86-64-pc-msys-shared 

&emsp;&emsp;Steps:

&emsp;&emsp;Open the file `configure.ac` in libbacktrace folder.

&emsp;&emsp;Locate `LT_INIT`

&emsp;&emsp;Add `LT_INIT([win32-dll])` as seen in line 91 (applies for both Windows 32 bit and 64 bit)

&emsp;&emsp;Save the file

&emsp;&emsp;![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234187967-38334f3b-dae9-46b3-b347-8dc84839b348.png)

&emsp;&emsp;Go to `Makefile.am` inside the libbacktrace folder.

&emsp;&emsp;Locate the block of variables that define the linker flags for `libbacktrace.la` (as seen in line 79 to 88).

&emsp;&emsp;As seen in line 88, add the line `libbacktrace_la_LDFLAGS = -no-undefined`, or just add `-no-undefined` if the variable already exists.

&emsp;&emsp;Once you have modified the `Makefile.am` file, save it.

&emsp;&emsp;You will need to regenerate the `Makefile.in` file by running the `autoreconf` command. After that, you should be able to rebuild libbacktrace with the `-no-undefined` flag.

&emsp;&emsp;Run the `autoreconf -fi` command

&emsp;&emsp;![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234188100-f81af243-b19e-4be3-a923-e636abca0840.png)

&emsp;&emsp;If you do not have command `autoreconf` installed in your MSYS2, you need to first install it (similar to how we install `make` command in the preceding section).

&emsp;&emsp;![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234188179-1a74240d-54f0-41ac-952b-b1c1cd00033b.png)

2. `libtool: link: false cru. libs/libbacktrace.a atomic.o dwarf.o fileline.o posix.o print.o sort.o state.o backtrace.o simple.o pecoff.o read.o alloc.o`

&emsp;&emsp;Solution sources:

&emsp;&emsp;Reason of error: Libtool uses `false cru` instead of `ar cru`

&emsp;&emsp;Steps:

&emsp;&emsp;Install `ar` in your MSYS2, configure the `$PATH` of your `ar` in MSYS2 (either temporary or permanent way). After that, if you are able to see the path for your `ar`, then you can run the `autoreconf -fi`, then run `./configure CC=/c/mingw64/bin/gcc.exe CXX=/c/mingw64/bin/g++.exe` and `make` command again.
	
&emsp;&emsp;If the path is not found from `$PATH`, try to explicitly define it in `./configure` (temporary environment variable only available on current MSYS2 terminal session)

&emsp;&emsp;![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234188417-fb483eea-5b49-45a9-93b3-e4386ca783c5.png)

&emsp;&emsp;To check if `ar` has been successfully installed:

&emsp;&emsp;`ar --version`

&emsp;&emsp;To check where your `ar` is installed:

&emsp;&emsp;`which ar`

&emsp;&emsp;To check your environment variables in MSYS:

&emsp;&emsp;`echo $PATH`

&emsp;&emsp;To add path for your `ar` permanently:

&emsp;&emsp;`nano ~/.bashrc`

&emsp;&emsp;`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/ar`

&emsp;&emsp;Write the `export` line of code at the end of the line of `bashrc`, save the file and exit. Make sure you enter the correct path of your `ar` inside the `export` code.

&emsp;&emsp;It is good to run the `autoreconf -fi` command again to regenerate `configure` script. And then run `./configure CC=/c/mingw64/bin/gcc.exe CXX=/c/mingw64/bin/g++.exe` and `make` command again.

**OpenSSL related issues**

When running `cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DSIRIUS_DRIVE_MULTI=ON ..` command, you may encounter issue related to unsuitable OpenSSL version. The possible cause of this issue might be because you have incompatible OpenSSL version in your machine, or probably you install the lower version of OpenSSL together with Qt installation.

The error may look like:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234188548-83884287-5cf2-4827-96a6-91deea6a53e8.png)

In this case, you just need to install the required version of OpenSSL (version 1.1.1 variants). Please do not install OpenSSL version 3 because the Boost library does not support it yet. Donâ€™t forget to also set the environment variable for your installed OpenSSL.

To install, follow this steps:

Open this link: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html 

Depending on your machine (32 or 64 bit), install Win32 OpenSSL v1.1.1t or Win64 OpenSSL v1.1.1t
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234195245-b53876ba-e23a-4782-bb27-760476542e8a.png)

Follow this link for installation steps:
https://thesecmaster.com/procedure-to-install-openssl-on-the-windows-platform/ 

**GTest related Issues**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234189116-c0d5daff-5ff4-4524-afc2-d7c8dbfc007c.png)

This means you have not installed GTest yet.

Follow the installation steps in this link:
https://youtu.be/3zUqJEilhnM 

And then try to re-build again.

**cpp-xpx-storage-user-app build related Issues**

`cmake` command related issue
- Qt State Machine not found (Qt5StateMachineConfig.cmake or qt5statemachine-config.cmake is not found)

&emsp;&emsp;![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121498420/234189291-6de330f1-01b3-467d-b3b3-26ac3f8ab1c8.png)

&emsp;&emsp;- Try to search the required file inside your Qt folder installation and set the required system variable with the correct file path. After that, exit the command prompt and try running the command again.

&emsp;&emsp;- If you cannot find the State Machine Config file, install it using the Maintenance Tool (this can be solved easier if you use online installer to install Qt). If you are using an offline installer, it requires a repository to install the components. You can try to refer to this link for the installation repository: https://forum.qt.io/topic/31796/no-default-repositories-in-maintenance-tool/6 

&emsp;&emsp;- If you are using Qt version 5, try installing Qt version 6 instead. You can try to install Qt version 6.4.3 instead (or the latest version of Qt) using the online installer.
