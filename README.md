### Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/proximax-storage/cpp-xpx-storage-user-app.git
cd cpp-xpx-storage-user-app
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
```

### C++ compiler with C++20 support
Set your preferred IDE to enable C++20 support. 
Make sure that you can run C++20 code. Try running some sample code and see whether it can successfully run and produces correct output.

You can try this sample code:
```
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    auto result = (10 <=> 20) > 0;
    std::cout << "result: " << result << std::endl;
}

```
The correct output should be:
```result: 0```

In case you are using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and you are not able to enable C++20 support. You can try to download Microsoft Visual Studio (Visual Studio) instead (see `Troubleshooting` > `C++20 related Issues` section below).

### Install CMake

And then press `Next`, and wait for the installation.

** Please note that the installation may take time since there are a lot to install.

After installation is complete, you can exit the installer.

According to your installation folder and Qt version, add a new system variable:
```
QT_PATH     C:\Qt\6.2.4\mingw_64
```

### Install MinGW-W64

If you do not have MinGW-W64 installed, download the 12.1.0 MSVCRT runtime version from here https://winlibs.com/

Extract the zip file to your C: drive, then add `C:\mingw64\bin` to PATH in system variables.

### Install Boost 1.79.0

Download boost zip folder from: https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_79_0.html

Extract to C: drive.

Now go to C: drive using Command Prompt, then run:

```
cd boost_1_79_0
bootstrap gcc
b2
b2 --build-dir=build/x64 address-model=64 threading=multi --build-type=complete --stagedir=./stage/x64 -j 4
```

** Preferably use command prompt, as Windows PowerShell might not work when running `bootstrap gcc` command

** Note that running the last two b2 commands may take time.

Add the following to your system variables:
```
BOOST_BUILD_PATH    "C:\boost_1_79_0\tools\build"
BOOST_INCLUDEDIR    "C:\boost_1_79_0"
BOOST_LIBRARYDIR    "C:\boost_1_79_0\stage\x64\lib"
BOOST_ROOT          "C:\boost_1_79_0"
```

### Build cpp-xpx-storage-user-app
From cmd, go to the cpp-xpx-storage-user-app directory, then do the following:
```
cd cpp-xpx-storage-client
mkdir _build
cd _build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DSIRIUS_DRIVE_MULTI=ON ..
mingw32-make -j 6
```

### Run Storage Client
In the build folder, an executable with the name "cpp-xpx-storage-client.exe" would have been created after the build is complete.
Double click the exe file, and if it crashes, don't worry. A folder with the name "profile" would be created, and file called "settings.ini" will be there.
Open the file and modify the address and bootstrap_nodes settings as follows (assuming blockchain and rest server are running locally):
```
address=localhost:5555
bootstrap_nodes=localhost:3000
```
